In this example we are going to see how to get Contact Information on your own Android Application. This is an example that demonstrates the appropriate queries (basically there are translated to SQLite queries) you should use in order to get the information you want about Contacts. Of course you can customize the display of the Contact List (here we use just a simple TextView). For example you can use ListView. Furthermore, you can query for more information, like for instance Email TYPE or even Images that you might have assigned to your contacts (this would make your ListView look very interesting)
